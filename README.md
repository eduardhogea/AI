# AI

Assignments that I did for Artificial Intelligence while studying in Austria at Johannes Kepler University. For each assignment, there was a problem instance encoded as a JSON file. I was needed to run my code to solve it and return the answer.

Summary of the algorithms implemented on specified frameworks:
1 - Implementing Breadth First Search
2 - Iterative Deepening Search
3 -  Uniform Cost Search
4 - Greedy Best First Search
5 - Aâˆ— Search
6 - Minimax
7 - Alphabeta
8 - Q-Learning
9 - ID3
