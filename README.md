# AI

Assignments that I did for Artificial Intelligence while studying in Austria at Johannes Kepler University. For each assignment, there was a problem instance encoded as a JSON file. I was needed to run my code to solve it and return the answer.<br/>

Summary of the algorithms implemented on specified frameworks:<br/>
1 - Implementing Breadth First Search<br/>
2 - Iterative Deepening Search<br/>
3 -  Uniform Cost Search<br/>
4 - Greedy Best First Search<br/>
5 - Aâˆ— Search<br/>
6 - Minimax<br/>
7 - Alphabeta<br/>
8 - Q-Learning<br/>
9 - ID3<br/>
